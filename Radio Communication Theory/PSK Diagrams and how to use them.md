## Constellation Diagram 
###### What is it and how to use it?
- what is it?
	- It helps show frequency, phase, and timing errors
- how to use it?
	- Frequency error - the constellation will be spinning.
	- Phase error - the constellation may show dots that are offset from their desired phase position 
		- Remember frequency is just phase change over time
	- Timing error - the constellation clusters will be spread out rather than be tight clusters
## Eye Diagram 
###### What is it and how to use it?
- what is it?
	- it provides detailed information on symbol timing synchronization 
- how to use it?
	- the eye diagram plots samples and shows sample period on x axis vs amplitude of the sample.
	- the WIDER the eye the better and cleaner the sample
	- the point where the eye closes should land exactly at 0 sps to show we are doing good symbol timing
