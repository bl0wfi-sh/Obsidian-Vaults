Oak ridge national labs provides research on top 500 super computers and how to perform high performance computing
GPU is where the meat of performance is. Use the GPU!
Floating point arithmetic is FAST coms is what's slow communication between processors is slow.
Hardware/software co-design is needed to develop the most efficient compute and not waste time on porting code over and over.
